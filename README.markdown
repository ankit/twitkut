Twitkut
-------

A twitter application for Orkut. It uses OAuth to allow you to post updates to your Twitter account from within Orkut. It also displays your tweets on your Orkut profile page and lets you view your Orkut friends' tweets (those using Twitkut)

**Note:**

I am _**no longer**_ maintaining this project. However, if someone improves the code and sends me a patch/pull request, I'll happily merge it and update the code on my server.

The code is very messy! Due to time constraints, I haven't been able to structure the code as I would've wished.

It may also serve useful for anyone looking for an example on how to write an Opensocial 0.8 application.
